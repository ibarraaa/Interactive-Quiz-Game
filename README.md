 Interactive Quiz Game
Another interesting Javascript project idea is an interactive quiz game where users can answer questions and receive immediate feedback on their responses. Start by designing the quiz layout using HTML and CSS. Next, use JavaScript to handle the logic of presenting questions, accepting user answers, and providing feedback on accuracy. Finally, store the quiz questions and answers in an array or object and randomize the order of questions for added variety.
